**I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor in U.S. System) at the University of Melbourne** and an honorary/adjunct senior lecturer (honorary Associate Professor in U.S. System) at the University of Sydney, University of Edinburgh, and POSTECH. I am currently co-leader of AD-NLP (Australia Deep Learning NLP Group). After my Ph.D.(in 2017), I started working at the University of Sydney and established the USYDNLP group in 2019 with Dr. Josiah Poon. My recent research interests include Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. I am broadly interested in several research topics, including visual-linguistic multi-modal learning, abusive language detection, document layout analysis, explainable AI, and recommender systems.
